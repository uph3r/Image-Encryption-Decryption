# Image Encryption Decryption

- It is used to convert an image into an unrecognizable format (encryption) and then converting it back to its original format (decryption) using cryptographic techniques. 

- This ensures the image's confidentiality during transmission or storage.



## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install cryptography(dependencies)

```
pip install cryptography
```
    
## Usage
